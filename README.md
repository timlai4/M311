# MATH-M 311 Calculus III
My class materials and notes for M311 recitation I taught in Fall 2019 at [Indiana University](https://www.iu.edu/). The class [notes](https://github.com/timlai4/M311/blob/master/Class.pdf) were written in TeX with all intermediate files needed to generate included in the main directory. The quizzes, including both the originating TeX files and PDF are under the [Quizzes](https://github.com/timlai4/M311/tree/master/Quizzes) directory. The code for the grade calculator app I designed for the students is under https://github.com/timlai4/Grade_calculator_heroku.
